                        <p>Diving goes way beyond exploring beneath the surface of the water.

                        <p>Not all suits are created equal. Some wetsuits and drysuits are specifically designed to beat back frigid, icy temps while others are meant to do little more than keep your skin protected from the sun. Similarly, some neoprene layers—such as BARE’s UltraWarmth base layers—are almost entirely designed to supplement other aquatic insulation systems.<br><sub>Huish Outdoors - October 16, 2020</sub></p>

                        <p>You’ve heard of Guam, Yap, Palau, and Truk. But if you’re planning a trip to the Federated States of Micronesia, the scuba diving in Kosrae is not to be missed. In fact, many visitors say Kosrae reminds them of Kauai in the 1960s — but the diving in these mid-Pacific, crystal-clear waters is way better. Where is Kosrae?<br><sub>Guest Author - October 05, 2020</sub></p>

                        <h2>Macro Life In The Mergui Archipelago: Part II</h2>
                        <p>he Mergui Archipelago in Myanmar (Burma) is a veritable playground for macro enthusiasts. This vast area features over 800 islands and 3,000 islets, flanked by pristine reefs. The seascape’s many nooks and crannies set the stage for a 3-ring circus of crustaceans, pipefish, seahorses, frogfish, cowries and nudibranchs, just to name a few. There is so much macro life in the Mergui Archipelago, in fact, that we’ve broken our guide into two parts. This is the second — find our first round of macro magic here.<br><sub> Camille Fogarolo - August 31, 2020</sub></p>

                        <h2>Diving With Giant Manta Rays in Ecuador</h2>
                        <p>Diving with giant manta rays in Ecuador is possible not only in the Galapagos, but also nearer to the coastline, which stretches for over 1,400 miles (2,300 km). Along that coastline, Isla de la Plata (also known as “the poor man’s Galapagos”) has an allure all its own. While overfishing in Isla De la Plata means that there is less marine life around than the Galapagos, the area recently became a no-take fishing zone and thusly marine life is predicted to increase.<br><sub>Juanita Pienaar - July 31, 2020</sub> </p>
